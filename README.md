GSM Panic Button Project
Overview
The GSM Panic Button is designed as a straightforward, user-friendly emergency alert system, featuring a large, easily noticeable red button. It's specifically tailored for elderly individuals who may find traditional communication devices challenging to use, particularly in urgent situations. This device is invaluable for those with conditions such as dementia, who might forget how to operate regular phones during emergencies.

Upon pressing the panic button, the device initiates missed calls to a predefined list of mobile numbers and sends out text messages every 5 minutes. This alert process continues until the reset button is manually deactivated, ensuring continuous attempts to reach out for help until assistance is provided.

This project was inspired by and dedicated to my grandparents, whose struggles with dementia highlighted the need for a simple yet effective communication tool during emergencies.

Key Components

Simcom 7600G: 

The core GSM module enabling cellular communication features, including sending SMS messages and making calls.
Lillygo Carrier Board: Serves as the foundation for the Simcom 7600G, facilitating easy integration and deployment of the GSM module.
Purpose

The GSM Panic Button project aims to offer peace of mind for both elderly individuals and their families. By simplifying the process of calling for help, it bridges the gap between the need for immediate assistance and the technological limitations that may hinder timely communication.

Implementation

This project leverages the capabilities of the Simcom 7600G module, mounted on a Lillygo Carrier Board, to provide a reliable and efficient communication system. The physical design focuses on ease of use, with a prominent red button that can be easily activated in distress.

Why This Project Matters

In the face of challenges such as dementia, conventional methods of communication can become barriers rather than tools for assistance. The GSM Panic Button is a testament to the importance of adaptive technology that meets the needs of its users, ensuring that help is always just a button press away.
